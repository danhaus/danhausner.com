        <ExternalLink href="http://aimtal.com/">Aimtal</ExternalLink> is a Boston-base digital marketing agency, whose
        clients include companies like Trello and Confluence. I helped them to get technical things right: web

        London-based <ExternalLink href="https://dweet.com/">Dweet</ExternalLink> is Upwork for the fashion & luxury
        industries. My role was to aid the team in making their web app mobile friendly.

        <ExternalLink href="https://www.grow.football/">Grow Football</ExternalLink> delivers real-time football
        analysis to iPhones. I collaborated with their cutting-edge research team on my master&apos;s thesis, when I
        created an AI-based fitness mobile application to minimise the risk of sports injuries. The app uses
        iPhone&apos;s front-facing camera and computer vision in real-time to recognise & analyse the exercise and
        alerts the user of incorrect technique.

        Did you know that food production is responsible for{' '}

          26% of global greenhouse gas emissions

        ? My group project at Imperial College London developed the{' '}
        <ExternalLink href="https://foodprint.orth.uk/">Foodprint</ExternalLink> mobile app to inform general public on
        the CO<sub>2</sub> impact of the food they consume, or even better: before they consume it. The metrics is
        instantly computed from unpackaged food photos, barcodes, and recipes â€” this way the app can be easily used in
        the store and aid users in their responsible buy decisions.
