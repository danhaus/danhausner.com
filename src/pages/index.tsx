          I&apos;m a digital nomad. In my downtime, I thrive on being outdoors ‚Äî I especially like mountaineering,
          hiking, and climbing. I also do calisthenics and run regularly ‚Äî currently training for a marathon.

          I don&apos;t believe in 9‚Äì5, but I believe in working in a state of high productivity and resting/exercising
          when the productivity is low; in other words, getting things done efficiently whilst having a balanced life. I
          also strive for excellence, but not by default ‚Äî considering the cost of excellence is important. Building a
          great product for half the price may be much better ROI than spending the double on marginal improvements that
          make barely any difference to the end user.
